        I started this web site because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. 
        But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, 
        and they've become quite a hit.

        If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, 
        stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on 
        all things Halloween.
